    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. <br>
            Press the moistened rim into the salt. Fill the glass with ice.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, <br>
            and cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is crumbled, browned, and no longer pink, <br>
            about 7 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste, ketchup, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, paprika, and <br>
            pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni; <br>
            reduce heat to medium, and gently boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, <br>
            until pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 13 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and stir in Cheddar, ensuring cheese is fully melted and incorporated, <br>
            30 to 45 seconds. Let stand until thickened before serving, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
